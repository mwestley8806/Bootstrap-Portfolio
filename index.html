                        Hey, my name is Michael Westley and I am excited to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you. I am a Florida native
                        and spent almost my entire life in the Orlando area, I really believe it is because of this that
                        I have become an enormous theme park geek! Theme parks have been a huge part of my life, in fact
                        for 13 years of it, I dedicated myself to them as an employee of two of them boucing around through
                        various positions and departments learning and growing along the way. I have a number of interests
                        including, food, spending time outdoors, technology and travel. I have been married to my best friend,
                        Brent for just about a year and together we have two cats, a dog and a guinea pig, so I guess you
                        could say we also have a love for animals.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am incredibly excited about the next chapter of my life. Dropping everything I knew and taking this
                        leap has been scary, but through a lot of dedication, lots of hard work and a ton of support I know
                        that I have made the right choice to further myself. Taking this leap was not only important for
                        my own personal success, it was a way for me to change how I support my family and give us an opportunity
                        to grow that family the way we really want.
                    </p>
